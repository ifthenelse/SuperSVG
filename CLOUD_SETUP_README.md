# Cloud Setup (Consolidated)

Cloud platform comparison, costs, setup flows, and deployment process are consolidated in:

- [README.md](README.md)

Go directly to:

- Section 6: Cloud setup options (platforms/costs)
- Section 7: Install and run on cloud
- Section 8: Deployable service API contract

Helper scripts remain unchanged:

- `setup-lambda-labs.sh`
- `setup-aws-ec2.sh`
- `choose-platform.sh`
